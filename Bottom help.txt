When errors appear, this means that you have misinputted a character,
or performed an impossible calculation. Please try again after
adjusting your inputs.
To minimize errors, please use brackets to close values in complex
arithmetics, like this: sin(32+5) and (5!)*4
This calculator does not support auto-inserting, so numbers in brackets will not 
be automatically multiplied by numbers outside the brackets, e.g. 5(2) will not equal 10
Please remember that this calculator can only operate in degrees,
not radians!
