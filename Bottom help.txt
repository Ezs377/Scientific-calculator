When errors appear, this means that you have misinputted a character,
or performed an impossible calculation. Please try again after
adjusting your inputs.
To minimize errors, please use brackets to close values in complex
arithmetics, like this: sin(32+5) and (5!)*4
Please remember that this calculator can only operate in degrees,
not radians!
